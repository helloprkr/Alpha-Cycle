# Questions for Cycle 6

## Q1

Conduct a comprehensive literature search on inference-time scaling for non-verifiable tasks using at least three parallel search queries to capture varying terminology (open-ended generation, subjective evaluation, creative tasks) and work from adjacent fields like human evaluation and preference learning. Identify the 5-10 most significant papers from the last two years, prioritizing those with high community engagement. For each paper, provide a brief summary of its methodology, its specific contribution to the field, its publication timeframe, and the exact link to the paper.
