# Questions for Cycle 1

## Q1

To ensure we are bridging domains with academic precision, conduct a structured "Technical Trace" search on the Chinese Remainder Theorem in neural network and machine learning architectures.

**Technical Keywords** (use at least three parallel search queries spanning):
- Number theory: Chinese Remainder Theorem, modular arithmetic, residue number systems, coprime decomposition
- Neural computation: matrix decomposition, efficient inference, parallel computation, weight factorization
- Efficient ML: quantization, low-precision arithmetic, hardware-efficient neural networks
- Adjacent fields: finite field neural networks, homomorphic encryption ML, number-theoretic transforms

**Bridging Logic Being Investigated:**
Evidence that CRT or modular arithmetic structures have been explicitly used for neural network optimization, or that such structures emerge implicitly in trained networks.

**Conceptual Narrative:**
We are investigating whether the Chinese Remainder Theorem—which enables decomposition of computations over a large modulus into parallel computations over smaller coprime moduli—has been applied to neural network architecture design for efficiency gains, quantization, or novel attention mechanisms.

**Organization Filter:**
Prioritize contributions from Google Research, DeepMind, Meta FAIR, NVIDIA Research, and academic groups working on efficient ML (MIT, Stanford, CMU).

Identify the 5-10 most significant papers from the last two years with high community engagement. For each paper, provide methodology summary, specific contribution to the bridging logic, publication timeframe, and exact link.

Highlight any papers that mention number theory, modular arithmetic, or CRT with emergent connections to neural networks, as these represent potential "missing pieces."
