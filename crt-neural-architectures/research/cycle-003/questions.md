# Questions for Cycle 3

## Q1

Building on findings from Cycles 1-2 about emergent modular structure and the Clock/Pizza algorithms, conduct a focused "Technical Trace" on grokking phenomena and modular arithmetic circuits in neural networks.

**Technical Keywords** (use at least three parallel search queries spanning):
- Grokking: delayed generalization, phase transitions in learning, algorithmic learning
- Modular circuits: Fourier features in neural networks, circular representations, modular arithmetic in transformers
- Mechanistic interpretability: circuit analysis, weight space geometry, representation learning dynamics
- Adjacent fields: singular learning theory, neural tangent kernel, dynamical systems in deep learning

**Bridging Logic Being Investigated:**
Evidence that grokking transitions correspond to emergence of modular/CRT-like computational structures, and that this represents a fundamental algorithmic discovery by neural networks.

**Conceptual Narrative:**
We are investigating whether the grokking phenomenon - where models suddenly generalize after extended training - corresponds to the network discovering modular arithmetic algorithms (like CRT decomposition), and whether this discovery has universal properties across architectures.

**Organization Filter:**
Prioritize contributions from Anthropic (mechanistic interpretability), DeepMind, EleutherAI, and researchers on grokking (Neel Nanda, Tom Lieberum).

Identify the 5-10 most significant papers from the last two years. For each paper, provide methodology summary, contribution to grokking/modularity understanding, publication timeframe, and exact link.
